Trying to archive some of the best posts from r/firefox over the years.

Two years ago, [mitcheecostelo](https://www.reddit.com/user/mitcheecostelo) posted about an "[aesthetic firefox icon to replace the default icon!](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/ig0n5q/my_girlfriend_made_an_aesthetic_firefox_icon_to/)" that his girlfriend [Ritozilla](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ritozilla) had created. 

As you can see, it is clearly adorable.
