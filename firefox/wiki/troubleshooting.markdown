Mozilla has a list of [basic troubleshooting](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/troubleshoot-and-diagnose-firefox-problems) steps. These can solve **almost every problem**. 

## Basic solutions

Try [clearing cookies and data](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox#w_clear-cookies-for-the-current-website) for a single site.

If you do not use any assistive technologies (such as screen readers, braille displays, narrators, etc), try [disabling accessibility services](https://web.archive.org/web/20240608190300/https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/accessibility-services).

If the problem is with a certain site, like you can't login, or certain functionality that used to work no longer works, try [clearing the site's data](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox#w_clear-cookies-for-the-current-website).

If no pages load at all, or take a long time to load, check your [connection settings](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/connection-settings-firefox) and try setting the **No Proxy** setting. If this works, your antivirus may be causing this issue. To fix this problem, disable or uninstall the antivirus, and the case should be resolved.

Try [troubleshoot mode](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/troubleshoot-and-diagnose-firefox-problems#w_3-restart-firefox-in-troubleshoot-mode). If it works in troubleshoot mode, it is likely a problem with an add-on.

[Reinstall Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/troubleshoot-and-diagnose-firefox-problems#w_4-reinstall-firefox) - sometimes Firefox itself can get corrupted or have a bad update. This generally doesn't do anything (mostly because this isn't the problem), but sometimes it does. Don't be discouraged if this doesn't work. 

## More advanced solutions

### Refreshing your profile

If troubleshoot mode and reinstalling Firefox doesn't work, you probably have a corrupt profile. This can be fixed by [refreshing Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings).  

[Refreshing Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings) creates a fresh new profile for you without losing your bookmarks, history, passwords, and so on. You **will lose your preferences and add-ons though**, so make sure to export your settings, if the extension offers it. This will fix most people's issues. If you are reading this from a comment on a post on reddit and you would prefer not to refresh your profile without trying other troubleshooting steps, feel free to skip this step. 

* You can [perform a complete backup of your profile](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/back-and-restore-information-firefox-profiles).
* Using [Firefox Sync](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/how-do-i-set-sync-my-computer) with multiple devices can restore your add-ons and some of your settings.

### New Profile

If all of the above doesn't work, you may have a very damaged profile. This is rare. You can try a brand [new profile](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/troubleshoot-and-diagnose-firefox-problems#w_6-create-a-new-firefox-profile) without any of your settings. 

* Using [Firefox Sync](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-set-sync-my-computer) with multiple devices can restore your add-ons and some of your settings.
